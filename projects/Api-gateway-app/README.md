# API Gateway

The Gateway is an access point for a user to the services. 
It can route requests to either Inventory API on `/api/movies` or Billing API on `api/billing`. 

It uses a proxy system to forward requests to the appropriate service. 

Refer to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` for detailed API documentation.
